BulkList
========

Idea
----
Find a div with id *ID*, append two child nodes named *ID_list* and *ID_bulk*.
*ID_list* is a list whereas *ID_bulk* is a textarea where you can copy-paste
lines of items. Each line should correspond to a line in the *ID_list*.

Rules
-----
Each line in *ID_list* must be unique.

Future work
-----------
Each line in *ID_list* must be removable.
Pre-populate the *ID_list* using a callback.
