BulkList
========

Idea
----
Find a div with id *<ID>*, append two child nodes named *<IDlist>* and *<IDbulk>*.
*<IDlist>* is a list whereas *<IDbulk>* is a textarea where you can copy-paste
lines of items. Each line should correspond to a line in the *<IDlist>*.

Rules
-----
Each line in *<IDlist>* must be unique.
Each line in *<IDlist>* must be removable.

Future work
-----------
Pre-populate the *<IDlist>* using a callback.
